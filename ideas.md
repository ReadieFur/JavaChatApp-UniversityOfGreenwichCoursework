- See if there is a builtin websocket library.
- If not look into using a tcp connection and either try to replicate the websocket protocol or implement my own custom protocol.
- When migrating hosts, have the server tell the clients which client to connect to as the new host.
- If the host server ends unexpectedly, have the clients use their peer list and try to connect to each one in order, if unsuccessful, become the host.
