The reason for doing this is to prevent race conditions when multiple clients are trying to reconnect at the same time, while this is not a foolproof method, it greatly reduces the chance of reconnection issues. If I went back and modified the program I would have the coordinator tell all peers who the next host would be before disconnecting, I would then keep this current method for when the coordinator disconnects unexpectedly.  \n",

If we fail to connect to any of the old peers then we fall back to checking the original server IP address that was specified when we first started the application. If we still fail to connect to a server instance then we will start hosting our own server instance and in-turn becoming the new coordinator.  \n",

My reason for taking this abstract approach was to reduce the amount of duplicated code, this is because the way host and client sockets work in java are very similar, and so I can write the same base code for both classes and then extend or override methods as needed.  \n",

    "\n",
    "There are also a few times I make use of protected variation, an example of this can be seen in my [ServerPeer](./src/chat_app/backend/ServerPeer.java) class. This class is an extension of the `Peer` class, however it exposes some variables of the `Peer` class that should only be modified by a server instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pattern I have used is the factory patten. This is used twice in my code, once for the creation of the `ServerClientHost` class, which is responsible for handling a single connection to another peer, the other time I use it is for my UI parser.\n",

    "I also make use of many decorator patterns, particularly in my UI builder. If we take a look at the file [ConfigurationUI.java](./src/chat_app/frontend/ConfigurationUI.java#L93) we can see that I have added many property decorators. These decorators are used to tell the UI builder how to build certain parts of the UI or how to handle certain events. For example if we take a look at line `93` we can see that the there is an attribute called `EventCallbackAttribute` which is attached to the method `Connect_Click`, the use of this decorator tells the UI builder that when the `Connect` button is clicked it should call the method `Connect_Click`."

    "The UI building starts within the [XMLUI](./src/readiefur/xml_ui/XMLUI.java) class. All custom elements will extend from this virtual class and specify the root component type as the generic parameter. Then using reflection, the virtual class will search for an xml file with the same class name as the one that extends it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next file that we should focus on is the [UIBuilderFactory](./src/readiefur/xml_ui/factory/UIBuilderFactory.java) class. This class is where the XML file will be parsed into a tree of Java Swing `Component` objects. Inside of here we have a recursive method called `ParseXMLNode` which is the first stage in converting an XML node into a Java Swing `Component` object. This method will apply common properties such as the `name` of the element, configure any binding attributes, as well as applying any custom properties that it finds on the corresponding Java class for that XML node.  \n",
    "After that the method will call the `ParseChildTree` on the component wrapper which will then compute any other properties for that element and then recursively call the `ParseXMLNode` method on each child node if applicable.  \n",
    "Once this has all completed the root Java Swing `Component` object will be returned and then set as the `rootComponent` variable of the `XMLUI` class which the extended class can call upon."
